# Quantium-Virtual-Internship-Task-3-Analytics-Report-Commercial-Application

Overview
Task 3 synthesizes insights from prior analyses into a concise, business-facing analytics report using the Pyramid Principle.
The goal: Translate analytics findings into actionable recommendations for the supermarket’s Category Manager, supporting strategic planning for the chips category.

Project Summary
Objective: Deliver a client-ready report with compelling visuals, callouts, and recommendations based on rigorous data analytics of the chips category.
Role: Analyst/Consultant (Simulated in Forage’s Quantium internship).

Focus Areas:
Data storytelling (Pyramid Principle framework)
Executive summary and commercial insights
Visualization best practices for business audiences
Data Sources & Context
Analysis builds on cleaned/merged outputs from Task 1 and Task 2.
Datasets include transactions, customer segmentation, and uplift experiment results for a major supermarket group.

Business Questions
What key customer segments drive category sales?
How did trial store layout changes impact performance?
What actionable strategies can maximize future category growth?

Approach
Report Structure:
Applied the Pyramid Principle—starting with high-level recommendations, followed by supporting evidence and data visualizations.

Visualization:
Created clear, audience-friendly charts (static PNGs and sunburst/bar charts) for inclusion in PowerPoint and PDF formats.

Insights:
Focused on the “so what?”—turning analytics into business actions.

Key Insights & Visualizations
Executive Summary:
Mainstream Young Singles/Couples and Retirees are the largest contributors to chip sales.
Trial store layout changes produced up to 22% sales uplift in select stores.
Data-driven recommendations target specific segments for greatest impact.

Seasonality:
Chip sales drop nearly 30% in December, reflecting holiday closures—inventory and promotions should be adjusted accordingly.

Segmentation:
Mainstream and Budget customers drive most sales; Premium segment spends more per trip but is smaller.

Visual: Stacked bar and sunburst charts highlight segment proportions and sales shares.

Experimentation:
Trial stores 77 and 88 showed strong uplift vs. controls; store 86 did not—suggesting demographic tailoring is key.

Visual Portfolio Includes:
Sales trend line charts with seasonal dip annotations
Stacked bar charts of sales by customer segment
Sunburst plots of customer mix
Uplift comparison charts (trial vs. control with percentile bands)

Pyramid Principle Structure
Executive Summary:
High-level findings and recommendations upfront for decision-makers.

Supporting Evidence:
Concise slides for each insight, each with clear visual and business callout.

Actionable Recommendations:
“What to do next”—always tied back to the data.

Recommendations
Focus marketing and promotions on high-value segments (Young Singles/Couples, Retirees, Mainstream, and Budget).
Roll out the new store layout to stores with similar demographics to Stores 77 and 88.
Extend trial or tailor strategies for stores with unique profiles (like Store 86).
Plan inventory and campaigns around clear seasonality (December dip).

How to Reproduce
Follow the data preparation and analytics steps from Task 1 and Task 2.
Create or download static PNGs of key visualizations.
Use the provided PowerPoint template or your own to assemble slides.
Executive summary, slides, and recommendations are included in the repository as a PDF (Task3_Quantium_Report.pdf) and as editable slides (.pptx).
